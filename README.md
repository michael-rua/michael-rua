I have strong web development experience through Enspiral Dev Academy. I strive to make socially responsible and environmentally sustainable software and bring positive vibes to everyone!

- (WIP) I am currently collaborating on Reciplan with a team I met in EDA. It is a weekly shopping manager that we made as a final project in 6 days, We hope it can help people with planning their food and shopping for the week. 
- I have plenty of repos which are exercises from EDA in which were part of my full-stack learning journey. They were great fun and I will continue to keep working on them.
